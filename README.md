## How it works

This app makes calls to pokeapi.co in order to access the information they have there. Each region is called in separate React components and lists out every Pokemon associated with them within an MUI Accordion component.
Simply click on the name of a Pokemon you want to look at, and basic information such as their name, sprites (including shiny if available), types, abilities, and base stats are listed in an easy-to-read format.
